## AwakenSMP

Hate Netherite for some reason? Want to not have rng combat in your server?

Simply install this plugin to make it impossible to craft netherite (or any tools/gear)!


# Commands

- /toggle - Just toggles the plugin

#Permissions

AntiNetherite.commands - Allows you to use the commands. You can add this permission using a permissions plugin or being serveroperator.

#Download

Want the jar? You can build it yourself, however I will post the resource on spigot's forums soon!
